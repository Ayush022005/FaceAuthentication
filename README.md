# üîí Face Authentication System with AES-256 Encryption & TensorFlow.js

Welcome to the **Face Authentication Web-Based System**! This project leverages cutting-edge technologies like **AES-256 encryption** and **TensorFlow.js** to implement a secure face recognition system. The system integrates **ChromaDB** for vector storage and utilizes the **K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)** algorithm for efficient face authentication.

## üöÄ Features

- **Face Embedding with TensorFlow.js**: Capture and process facial data directly in the browser.
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Ensure secure transmission and storage of face embedding data.
- **Vector Database Integration**: Face embeddings are stored in **ChromaDB** for fast and scalable vector search.
- **K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)** Algorithm: Used during authentication to compare new face embeddings with stored data for accurate identification.
- **Web-Based Interface**: Simple, intuitive front-end for easy interaction and secure authentication.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) for face embedding generation.
  - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the user interface.

- **Backend**:
  - **ChromaDB**: Vector database for storing and indexing face embeddings.
  - **AES-256**: Applied for encryption of face data before storage.
  - **K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**: Efficient matching and authentication.

## üîë How It Works

1. **Face Detection & Embedding**: 
   - Users' facial images are captured via webcam and processed using **TensorFlow.js** to generate face embeddings (vector representation of facial features).
   
2. **AES-256 Encryption**: 
   - These face embeddings are encrypted with **AES-256** to protect user privacy and data security during transmission to the server.
   
3. **Storage in ChromaDB**:
   - The encrypted face embeddings are stored in **ChromaDB**, a high-performance vector database designed for similarity searches.

4. **Authentication Process**:
   - During login, the system captures the user's face again, generates a new embedding, and uses the **K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)** algorithm to compare it against stored embeddings.
   - The system retrieves the closest matches, ensuring accurate and efficient authentication.

## üìö Installation & Setup

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-authentication-system.git
   

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   bash
   cd face-authentication-system
   

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - For the backend (Node.js, Express):
     bash
     npm install
     
   - For the frontend (TensorFlow.js):
     bash
     npm install @tensorflow/tfjs
     

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following:

   bash
   AES_SECRET_KEY=<your-aes-key>
   CHROMADB_URL=<your-chromadb-url>
   

5. **Run the Application**:
   bash
   npm start
   

6. **Access the App**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## üîê Security Considerations

- *AES-256 Encryption*: Ensures the secure transmission and storage of all facial embedding data.
- *Vector Privacy*: Face embeddings are stored in a vector database, not as raw images, further enhancing privacy.

## üß† Future Improvements

- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
- Optimize face embedding generation with custom TensorFlow models.
- Explore integration with other databases or vector storage systems.
- Enhance the K-NN algorithm with additional machine learning techniques.
